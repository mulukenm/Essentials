    "Statistics are based on data, which consist of a collection of pieces of information about things you want to study. This information can take the form of descriptions, quantities, measurements, and other observations. Typically, we work with related data items in a *dataset*, which often consists of a collection of *observations* or *cases*. Most commonly, we thing about this dataset as a table that consists of a row for each observation, and a column for each individual data point related to that observation - we variously call these data points *attributes* or *features*, and they each describe a specific characteristic of the thing we're observing.\n",

    "### Types of Data\n",
    "Now, let's take a closer look at this data (you can click the left margin next to the dataset to toggle between full height and a scrollable pane). There are 933 observations, each one recording information pertaining to an individual child. The information recorded consists of the following features:\n",
    "- **family**: An identifier for the family to which the child belongs.\n",
    "- **father**: The height of the father.\n",
    "- ** mother**: The height of the mother.\n",
    "- **midparentHeight**: The mid-point between the father and mother's heights (calculated as *(father + 1.08 x mother) &div; 2*)\n",
    "- **children**: The total number of children in the family.\n",
    "- **childNum**: The number of the child to whom this observation pertains (Galton numbered the children in desending order of height, with male children listed before female children)\n",
    "- **gender**: The gender of the child to whom this observation pertains.\n",
    "- **childHeight**: The height of the child to whom this observation pertains.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that there are several distinct types of data recorded here. To begin with, there are some features that represent *qualities*, or characteristics of the child - for example, gender. Other feaures represent a *quantity* or measurement, such as the child's height. So broadly speaking, we can divide data into *qualitative* and *quantitative* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qualitative Data\n",
    "Let's take a look at qualitative data first. This type of data is categorical - it is used to categorize or identify the entity being observed. Sometimes you'll see features of this type described as *factors*. \n",
    "##### Nominal Data\n",
    "In his observations of children's height, Galton assigned an identifier to each family and he recorded the gender of each child. Note that even though the **family** identifier is a number, it is not a measurement or quantity. Family 002 it not \"greater\" than family 001, just as a **gender** value of \"male\" does not indicate a larger or smaller value than \"female\". These are simply named values for some characteristic of the child, and as such they're known as *nominal* data.\n",
    "##### Ordinal Data\n",
    "So what about the **childNum** feature? It's not a measurement or quantity - it's just a way to identify individual children within a family. However, the number assigned to each child has some additional meaning - the numbers are ordered. You can find similar data that is text-based; for example, data about training courses might include a \"level\" attribute that indicates the level of the course as \"basic:, \"intermediate\", or \"advanced\". This type of data, where the value is not itself a quantity or measurement, but it indicates some sort of inherent order or heirarchy, is known as *ordinal* data.\n",
    "#### Quantitative Data\n",
    "Now let's turn our attention to the features that indicate some kind of quantity or measurement.\n",
    "##### Discrete Data\n",
    "Galton's observations include the number of **children** in each family. This is a *discrete* quantative data value - it's something we *count* rather than *measure*. You can't, for example, have 2.33 children!\n",
    "##### Continuous Data\n",
    "The data set also includes height values for **father**, **mother**, **midparentHeight**, and **childHeight**. These are measurements along a scale, and as such they're described as *continuous* quantative data values that we *measure* rather than *count*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample vs Population\n",
    "Galton's dataset includes 933 observations. It's safe to assume that this does not account for every person in the world, or even just the UK, in 1886 when the data was collected. In other words, Galton's data represents a *sample* of a larger *population*. It's worth pausing to think about this for a few seconds, because there are some implications for any conclusions we might draw from Galton's observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how many times you see a claim such as \"one in four Americans enjoys watching football\". How do the people who make this claim know that this is a fact? Have they asked everyone in the the US about their football-watching habits? Well, that would be a bit impractical, so what usually happens is that a study is conducted on a subset of the population, and (assuming that this is a well-conducted study), that subset will be a representative sample of the population as a whole. If the survey was conducted at the stadium where the Superbowl is being played, then the results are likely to be skewed because of a bias in the study participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we might look at Galton's data and assume that the heights of the people included in the study bears some relation to the heights of the general population in 1886; but if Galton specifically selected abnormally tall people for his study, then this assumption would be unfounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we deal with statistics, we usually work with a sample of the data rather than a full population. As you'll see later, this affects the way we use notation to indicate statistical measures; and in some cases we calculate statistics from a sample differently than from a full population to account for bias in the sample."

    "\n",
    "Let's examine some common kinds of data visualization:\n",
    "#### Bar Charts\n",
    "A *bar chart* is a good way to compare numeric quantities or counts across categories. For example, in the Galton dataset, you might want to compare the number of female and male children.\n",

    "#### Histograms\n",
    "Bar charts work well for comparing categorical or discrete numeric values. When you need to compare continuous quantitative values, you can use a similar style of chart called a *histogram*. Histograms differ from bar charts in that they group the continuous values into ranges or *bins* - so the chart doesn't show a bar for each individual value, but rather a bar for each range of binned values. Because these bins represent continuous data rather than discrete data, the bars aren't separated by a gap. Typically, a histogram is used to show the relative frequency of values in the dataset.\n",

In some cases you may want to explicitly control the number of bins, as this can help you see detail in the distribution of data values that otherwise you might miss.
